## Requirements for contributing

Working on this TypeScript package requires the following programs
to be installed on your system:

- `yarn` (required)
- `nvm` (recommended)

## Preparing your session

To prepare your session, `cd` to the project root directory, then
run `nvm use`.

## Installing dependencies

To install dependencies, run: `yarn install`

If that fails, consult the _Maintenance_ section.

## Building the package

To build the package, run: `yarn compile`

## Running unit tests

To execute the unit tests, run: `yarn test`

## Publishing the package to the NPM registry

(tbd)

## Maintenance

### yarn install

To install the current project dependencies as specified in
`package.json` and `yarn.lock`, run `yarn install`.

### yarn clean-install

If the Yarn version has changed and you run `yarn install`, Yarn
will try to upgrade itself. That causes changes to several files,
such as the `LICENSE` files I have placed into several
subdirectories.

Anytime that happens, run the `yarn clean-install` script, a wrapper
around `yarn install` which cleans up afterwards.

Note that the `yarn clean-install` script may fail and tell you to
run `yarn install` instead. I haven’t figured out why it does that.
If that happens, run `yarn install` followed by `yarn clean-install`.

### yarn outdated

To see a list of outdated packages, run: `yarn outdated`

### yarn upgrade-lockfile

This runs `yarn up -R '**' && yarn clean-install` behind the scenes
in order to upgrade all resolutions in the lockfile as far as
possible, but leaves your `package.json` as is.

### yarn upgrade-packages

The built-in `yarn up` command can be a bit cumbersome to use if you
want to upgrade all dependencies in one go.

Running the `yarn upgrade-packages` script will upgrade all relevant
dependencies. That includes the `@types`, `@typescript-eslint`, and
`@yarnpkg` scopes but excludes Yarn itself (see the
`yarn upgrade-yarn-itself` section).

### yarn upgrade-yarn-itself

To upgrade Yarn PnP to the latest available version, run the
`yarn upgrade-yarn-itself` script.

Note that the script will only print manual instructions. That’s
because Yarn makes changes to `package.json`, and that doesn’t play
well with Yarn PnP in scripts.

### yarn upgrade-all

To also upgrade Yarn itself, run `yarn upgrade-all`.

## Patching dependencies

Sometimes you may want to tweak a dependency. This section explains how to do that using `yarn patch`.

### Start editing

To start editing a dependency, run `yarn patch <dependency>`.

### Finish editing

To commit the patch, run `yarn repatch -- <workdir>`.

For example, if the temporary working directory is `/tmp/xfs-36e26fe6/user`, run:

```shell
yarn repatch -- /tmp/xfs-36e26fe6/user
```

Note: `yarn repatch` is a custom script. It serves to work around two issues in `yarn patch-commit`:

- Using bare `yarn patch-commit` would create a nested patch while amending the patch is what I actually want.

- It may also use an incorrect key in the resolution entry it writes to `package.json`.  
  The key should match the dependency’s semver expression, not the resolved version.
  Using the latter as a key causes the resolution to never apply.  
  Example for a correct key: `"@scope/pkgname@^0.1.2"`

## Handling vulnerable dependencies

### The thing about vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies

People sometimes discover vulnerabilities in packages on which
{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} depends.

If that happens and a patch comes out, I need to upgrade the
affected package to a newer version, which includes the patch.

But a vulnerability might also affect a package on which
{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} depends only indirectly, e.g. through a
transitive requirement. A patch may exist for such a package, but
somewhere in the chain of dependencies (from the vulnerable package
all the way down to {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}), the patch may be
outside the specified semver range so I **can’t upgrade** the
package via the usual `yarn up` or `yarn up -R` command.

### Dealing with the risk

If such cases arise, I’m going to try force-upgrading affected
packages, and document those upgrades in the section
_List of force-upgraded transitive dependencies_ below.  
Even if the upgrade happens to fail (or if it breaks the app and I
have to roll back the upgrade, leaving the vulnerability unpatched),
I’m also going to document that failure here.

## List of force-upgraded transitive dependencies

The goal of this list is:

- to document the drift between version requirements (in the tree
  of `package.json` files) and the resolutions in `yarn.lock`; and

- to inform about unpatched vulnerabilities.

<!-- Remove this line when adding the first entry: -->No entries yet.

<!--
I have preserved the order in which I have applied the upgrades.
The list starts with the first upgrade and ends with the latest one.
-->

<!--
### Vulnerability in …………, dependency of ………… v…………

I have manually bumped `…………`’s dependency `…………` to
v………… in order to bump the transitive dependency `…………` to v…………:

```shell
yarn set resolution --save …………@npm:………… …………
```

(Remove this section once an upgrade to `…………` is available
that depends on ………… v………… or higher.)

In each of the directories the table mentions, you will find one
license file, named `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt`.  
Each license file applies to the directory that contains it,
including all subdirectories, but excluding any subdirectory tree
whose root has a license file on its own.
